C S 429H Computer Architecture's final project by David Li, Yifan Ma, Yu Lim, Wen Chen.

# How to Run
- To run our project, compile and run main.cpp with the command .
- You should see the sprite table of the NES game Donkey Kong, which is as far as we got for the graphics by Tuesday night.
- On the other hand, the NES CPU (based on the MOS Technology 6502) and instruction set are fully emulated.
- All CPU instructions that ran should print in the console as a way to visualize the program running.
