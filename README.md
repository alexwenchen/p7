Computer Architecture final project of David Li, Yifan Ma, Yu Lim, Wen Chen.

Note: This project is built off of javidx9 (OneLoneCoder)'s NES emulator tutorial. We followed his tutorial and used his template for the general code structure.

To run our project, compile and run main.cpp. You should see a table of the sprites of the NES game Donkey Kong, which is as far as we got for the graphics. On the other hand, the CPU and instruction set are fully emulated. All of the instructions ran should print in the console.
